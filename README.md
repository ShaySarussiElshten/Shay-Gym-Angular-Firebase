#### Hello and welcome to "shay gym" ,the purpose of this app is to give a workouts program to users like:

####  measure the times for each workouts and keep track of all kinds of data like the amount/type of workouts ,and calculating how many calories we reduced from our body during the workout.

# Now, I will review some important functionality of the site:

#### presently I sign up for a system with a new username called "newuser@walla.com" and then when I log in I click on "past exercises" at this point because the user is new ,I dont see any record on his workouts table. :)
#### Finally I connect to the system with the user rotemxte@gmail.com and then I click on "past exercises" . now because this user has a history of his personal workouts, I see table (at the end of the video) of his workouts that he has done over time.

____________________________________________________________

#### I now follow the examples we did above in a look of responsive website

#### When we do a workout, then we may have finished it until the end of allotted time. Or we may have stopped it , before the time is over.


#### Suppose in this example we choose to do the exercise of: Horizontal bar

#### So I will present two possibilities:
#### option 1:
#### completion the workout in time:

![comleted task](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43005514/121646779-52ef7380-ca9e-11eb-911a-cc5ecadb056a.gif)

#### option 2:
#### completion the workout before the allotted time:


#### Now another workout is chosen let’s say “Shoulder press”

### but in this example we will stop it before its allotted time

![cancelled task](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43005514/121648821-96e37800-caa0-11eb-945f-1f9450d81270.gif)

____________________________________________________________

#### Note that the grid is perfectly matched with responsiveness

![grid-responsive](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43005514/121655063-00668500-caa7-11eb-9ac4-8f502299e16f.gif)

____________________________________________________________

#### Now let's log in with rotemxte@gmail.com and then when I log in I click on "past excerices" => 

#### Now as we know we will see the list of workouts he has done over time. 

#### I will now review the various of "functionality" options that i have in this table

#### 1. Filter results by search
#### 2. Re-order the table by some feature
#### 3. We also have pagination for our table
